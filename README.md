# libdgt

## A D Game Toolkit library

The project is written in D to take advantage of its ability for both low and high level programming. There's no need for a separate scripting language like Lua; both the engine and high-level code can be written in the same language.

## Required tools to build

- [dub](https://code.dlang.org/download), the D package manager
- [A D compiler](https://dlang.org/download.html), usually DMD

## Feature List

- Texture loading and rendering
- Automatic batched rendering
- Camera / viewport system
- Polygon, rectangle, and circle rendering
- Basic geometry module with circles, rects, etc.
- TTF Font rendering
- Sound playing API
- Streaming music API
- 2D tilemap for pixel-perfect geometry checking
- Particle system
- A basic Immediate Mode UI system
	- A button with different hover and pressed states
	- A slider that can allow for a non-discrete set of values
	- A carousel with a set of rotating values
- Automatic letterboxing
- User-created shaders
- Sprites and animated sprites
- Gamepad API
- Tiled JSON format support
